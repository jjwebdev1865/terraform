# Expressions and Functions

## Key Notes
- when iterating over a map, can return a list or map. and vice versa

## Exercise 1:  Operators in Terraform
- exercise link: https://github.com/lm-academy/terraform-course/blob/main/exercises/exercise22-operators.md
- can do standard math operators

## Exercise 2: Using expressions with lists - overview
- exercise link: https://github.com/lm-academy/terraform-course/blob/main/exercises/exercise23-for_lists.md
- check out directory **09-expressions** > for-list.tf
- going over the *for* expression
    * can do conditional checks inside of for expressions

## Exercise 3: Using for expressions with Maps
- exercise link: https://github.com/lm-academy/terraform-course/blob/main/exercises/exercise24-for_maps.md
- check out directory **09-expressions** > for-map.tf
    * shows how to change and use a map with the response also being a map

## Exercise 4: Transforming lists into maps and vice versa
