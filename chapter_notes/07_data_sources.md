# Data Sources

## Key Notes
- Data Sources => Query or retrieve data from APIs or other Terraform projects
- in the terraform registry, can search for **Data Sources** and all options will appear with examples

## Exercise 1: Using data sources to fetch AMI Information
- exercise link: https://github.com/lm-academy/terraform-course/blob/main/exercises/exercise10-data_source_ami_information.md
- check out directory **07-data-sources** > compute.tf to see data example

## Exercise 2: Using Data Sources to Fetch AWS Caller Identity and Region
- exercise link: https://github.com/lm-academy/terraform-course/blob/main/exercises/exercise11-data_source_aws_caller_identity_region.md
- Continued -> check out directory **07-data-sources** > compute.tf to see data example
- added the data aws_region and data aws_caller_identity
    * nothing needed but can see data in the output after running plan. very useful

## Exercise 3: Fetching VPC Data - Overview
- exercise link: https://github.com/lm-academy/terraform-course/blob/main/exercises/exercise12-data_source_vpc_information.md
- Continued -> check out directory **07-data-sources** > compute.tf to see data example

## Demo: Fetching AWS AZ
- Continued -> check out directory **07-data-sources** > compute.tf to see data example

## Exercise - Creat IAM Policies
- exercise link: https://github.com/lm-academy/terraform-course/blob/main/exercises/exercise13-data_source_iam_policy.md
- Continued -> check out directory **07-data-sources** > compute.tf to see data example
